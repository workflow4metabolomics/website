# How to contribute to the documentation?

If you want to contribute to this documentation on Workflow4Metabolomics, you will need to have a Github account first. Indeed, every files of this documentation are pushed in github and will stay there. To be able to accept new things from different people, we need to set some steps to follow:

1. Start by forking the repository: 

![fork this thing](../images/fork_picture.png)

2. Then you can work directly on github or clone the repository to your local environment (link clone)

3. Once you have saved your changes (with commits pushed on your forked repository) there should be an orange band like the following to ask for a pull request ![This is my PR](../images/pull_request_picture.png)

4. You just have to open this pull request and we will review it in order to validate it. Please think about explaining your changes in your newly opened pull request for us to know what is is all about. Once the pull request is aprouved, changes will appear on the website.


### Tip: Adding information on a page

If you just want to add some information on an existing page or update some deprecated information, it is quite easy to do. 
During the previous step n°2, you just have to open the file you want to change (on Github or on your local computer if cloned), make your changes and then save it in a new commit.
When your commit is saved with changes, the orange band will appear and you can proceed with the previous step n°3 (or continue by updating further content). 

### Tip: Creating a new page

It is also possible to add a new page on the website. This is different from the previous point because you will need to change the `_quarto.yml` file also. To be able to do this, start with thinking about *Where can my new page be on the website? A new item in the menu? A new tab in an existing one?*. 
Then in the file named `_quarto.yml` find the good part and add it with these information: 
```{R}
 - text: "Tools"
        icon: "tools"
        menu: 
          - text: "Tool 1"
            href: tool1.qmd
          - text: "My new tool"
            href: mynewtool.qmd
```

As you can see, you now need to create your new `mynewtool.qmd` file. In this file you can write all you want (in accordance with where it will be in the website of course!).
After all this is completed, as in the previous tip, just save and open the pull request explaining what you want to add for us to be able to evaluate its accordance to the website.


# Understand the website building



## The `publish.yml` file for deploying the website

The `publish.yml` file is a configuration file for GitHub Actions that automates the deployment of the Workflow4Metabolomics website. It is located in the `.github/workflows` directory of the GitHub repository. This file contains instructions on how to build and deploy the website whenever there is a change in the repository.

### Why set the target to the `gh-pages` branch?

The `gh-pages` target (defined in `target: gh-pages`) is used to specify the branch where the content generated by Quarto will be deployed. Here’s why this is important:

1. **Dedicated deployment branch**: The `gh-pages` branch is a convention used by GitHub Pages to host the static files of a website. By configuring this branch as the target, you indicate to GitHub Pages where to find the files to serve.

2. **Separation of source code and deployed content**: The source code of your project (e.g., Quarto, R files, etc.) remains in the main branch (`main`), while the generated files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) are deployed to `gh-pages`. This helps keep the repository clean and organized.

3. **Compatibility with GitHub Pages**: GitHub Pages is configured to automatically serve content from the `gh-pages` branch (or another branch specified in the repository settings). By using this branch, you ensure that the site will be correctly published.

In summary, the `target: gh-pages` directive is essential to indicate where the generated files should be deployed so that GitHub Pages can serve them as a website.
