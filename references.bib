We have developed Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M), the first fully open-source and collaborative online platform for computational metabolomics. W4M is a virtual research environment built upon the Galaxy web-based platform technology. It enables ergonomic integration, exchange and running of individual modules and workflows. Alternatively, the whole W4M framework and computational tools can be downloaded as a virtual machine for local installation.Availability and implementation: http://workflow4metabolomics.org homepage enables users to open a private account and access the infrastructure.W4M is developed and maintained by the French Bioinformatics Institute (IFB) and the French Metabolomics and Fluxomics Infrastructure (MetaboHUB).Contact  :  contact@workflow4metabolomics.org}",

abstract = {Metabolomics is a key approach in modern functional genomics and systems biology. Due to the complexity of metabolomics data, the variety of experimental designs, and the multiplicity of bioinformatics tools, providing experimenters with a simple and efficient resource to conduct comprehensive and rigorous analysis of their data is of utmost importance. In 2014, we launched the Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M; http://workflow4metabolomics.org) online infrastructure for metabolomics built on the Galaxy environment, which offers user-friendly features to build and run data analysis workflows including preprocessing, statistical analysis, and annotation steps. Here we present the new W4M 3.0 release, which contains twice as many tools as the first version, and provides two features which are, to our knowledge, unique among online resources. First, data from the four major metabolomics technologies (i.e., LC–MS, FIA–MS, GC–MS, and NMR) can be analyzed on a single platform. By using three studies in human physiology, alga evolution, and animal toxicology, we demonstrate how the 40 available tools can be easily combined to address biological issues. Second, the full analysis (including the workflow, the parameter values, the input data and output results) can be referenced with a permanent digital object identifier (DOI). Publication of data analyses is of major importance for robust and reproducible science. Furthermore, the publicly shared workflows are of high-value for e-learning and training. The Workflow4Metabolomics 3.0 e-infrastructure thus not only offers a unique online environment for analysis of data from the main metabolomics technologies, but it is also the first reference repository for metabolomics workflows.}

    abstract = { Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a well-known endocrine disruptor used to manufacture polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Exposure of pregnant rodents to low doses of BPA results in pleiotropic effects in their offspring. Objective: We used metabolomics—a method for determining metabolic changes in response to nutritional, pharmacological, or toxic stimuli—to examine metabolic shifts induced in vivo by perinatal exposure to low doses of BPA in CD-1 mice. Methods: Male offspring born to pregnant CD-1 mice that were exposed to vehicle or to 0.025, 0.25, or 25 µg BPA/kg body weight/day, from gestation day 8 through day 16 of lactation, were examined on postnatal day (PND) 2 or PND21. Aqueous extracts of newborns (PND2, whole animal) and of livers, brains, and serum samples from PND21 pups were submitted to 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Data were analyzed using partial least squares discriminant analysis. Results: Examination of endogenous metabolic fingerprints revealed remarkable discrimination in whole extracts of the four PND2 newborn treatment groups, strongly suggesting changes in the global metabolism. Furthermore, statistical analyses of liver, serum, and brain samples collected on PND21 successfully discriminated among treatment groups. Variations in glucose, pyruvate, some amino acids, and neurotransmitters (γ-aminobutyric acid and glutamate) were identified. Conclusions: Low doses of BPA disrupt global metabolism, including energy metabolism and brain function, in perinatally exposed CD-1 mouse pups. Metabolomics can be used to highlight the effects of low doses of endocrine disruptors by linking perinatal exposure to changes in global metabolism. }

    abstract = {Summary Colonizations of freshwater by marine species are rare events, and little information is known about the underlying mechanisms. Brown algae are an independent lineage of photosynthetic and multicellular organisms from which few species inhabit freshwater. As a marine alga that is also found in freshwater, Ectocarpus is of particular interest for studying the transition between these habitats. To gain insights into mechanisms of the transition, we examined salinity tolerance and adaptations to low salinities in a freshwater strain of Ectocarpus on physiological and molecular levels. We show that this isolate belongs to a widely distributed and highly stress-resistant clade, and differed from the genome-sequenced marine strain in its tolerance of low salinities. It also exhibited profound, but reversible, morphological, physiological, and transcriptomic changes when transferred to seawater. Although gene expression profiles were similar in both strains under identical conditions, metabolite and ion profiles differed strongly, the freshwater strain exhibiting e.g. higher cellular contents of amino acids and nitrate, higher contents of n-3 fatty acids, and lower intracellular mannitol and sodium concentrations. Moreover, several stress markers were noted in the freshwater isolate in seawater. This finding suggests that, while high stress tolerance and plasticity may be prerequisites for the colonization of freshwater, genomic alterations have occurred that produced permanent changes in the metabolite profiles to stabilize the transition.},

    abstract = {Abstract Various spectrometric methods can be used to conduct metabolomics studies. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with separation methods, such as liquid or gas chromatography (LC and GC, respectively), are the most commonly used techniques. Once the raw data have been obtained, the real challenge lies in the bioinformatics required to conduct: (i) data processing (including preprocessing, normalization, and quality control); (ii) statistical analysis for comparative studies (such as univariate and multivariate analyses, including PCA or PLS-DA/OPLS-DA); (iii) annotation of the metabolites of interest; and (iv) interpretation of the relationships between key metabolites and the relevant phenotypes or scientific questions to be addressed. Here, we will introduce and detail a stepwise protocol for use of the Workflow4Metabolomics platform (W4M), which provides user-friendly access to workflows for processing of LC–MS, GC–MS, and NMR data. Those modular and extensible workflows are composed of existing standalone components (e.g., XCMS and CAMERA packages) as well as a suite of complementary W4M-implemented modules. This tool suite is accessible worldwide through a web interface and is hosted on UseGalaxy France. The extensible Virtual Research Environment (VRE) provided offers pre-configured workflows for metabolomics communities (platforms, end users, etc.), as well as possibilities for sharing among users. By providing a consistent ecosystem of tools and workflows through Galaxy, W4M makes it possible to process MS and NMR data from hundreds of samples using an ordinary personal computer, after step-by-step workflow optimization. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
