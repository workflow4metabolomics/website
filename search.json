    "text": "Background: Colonizations of freshwater by marine species are rare events, and little information is known about the underlying mechanisms. Brown algae are an independent lineage of photosynthetic and multicellular organisms from which few species inhabit freshwater. As a marine alga that is also found in freshwater, Ectocarpus is of particular interest for studying the transition between these habitats.\nObjective: To gain insights into mechanisms of the transition, we examined salinity tolerance and adaptations to low salinities in a freshwater strain of Ectocarpus on physiological and molecular levels.\nResults: We show that this isolate belongs to a widely distributed and highly stress-resistant clade, and differed from the genome-sequenced marine strain in its tolerance of low salinities. It also exhibited profound, but reversible, morphological, physiological, and transcriptomic changes when transferred to seawater. Although gene expression profiles were similar in both strains under identical conditions, metabolite and ion profiles differed strongly, the freshwater strain exhibiting e.g. higher cellular contents of amino acids and nitrate, higher contents of n-3 fatty acids, and lower intracellular mannitol and sodium concentrations. Moreover, several stress markers were noted in the freshwater isolate in seawater.\nConclusion: This finding suggests that, while high stress tolerance and plasticity may be prerequisites for the colonization of freshwater, genomic alterations have occurred that produced permanent changes in the metabolite profiles to stabilize the transition.\nDataset:\nThe dataset contains 12 GC-MS injection of Ectocarpus sp. (Ectocarpales, Phaeophyceae) samples.\nWorkflow:\nThe W4M workflow use XCMS Matched Filter method for peak detection."

    "text": "Overview Processing, statistical analysis, and annotation of metabolomics data is a complex task for experimenters since it involves many steps and requires a good knowledge of both the methodology and software tools. The Workflow4metabolomics.org (W4M) online infrastructure provides a user-friendly and high-performance environment with advanced computational modules for building, running, and sharing complete workflows for LC-MS, GC-MS, and NMR analysis. Such features are of major values for teaching computational metabolomics to experimenters, and previous courses using W4M since 2014 have been very successful.\nPre-Registration are closed now !! Goals: During this one-week course, participants will learn how to use the W4M infrastructure to analyze their own dataset. Morning sessions will be dedicated to methodology and tools. Afternoon sessions will be devoted to tutoring.\nDate: Monday 8th to Friday October 12th 2018\nCosts: 900 € for academic and 2000 € for private institution to cover expenses for trainers (12), organization, materials and meals\nIncluding : Lunch, coffee break, pedagogic support and the Thursday social event\nNot included : travel expenses, accomodation and 3 diners (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday)\nTarget audience: LC-MS, GC-MS, NMR, FIA-MS and DI-MS experimenters (e.g. biologists, chemists).\nMaterials: Participants will use their laptop to perform the analysis on their W4M account. All presentations, reference datasets and workflows will be available online.\nTutors: Each participant will be paired with a tutor who will help him/her prepare the data and assist him/her during each analysis step.\nLocation : Pasteur Institute - Paris\nLanguage: English\nNumber of attendees: 25 max.\nKeynote speakers: Julien Boccad (University of Geneva, Switzerland), Christoph Steinbeck (Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany)\nSponsors: ELIXIR, French Bioinformatics Institute (IFB), French Infrastructure for Metabolomics and Fluxomics (MetaboHUB), Francophone Network for Metabolomics and Fluxomics (RFMF)\nProgram\n\n\n\nPlanning 2018\n\n\nOrganizing committee ELIXIR-France (IFB) : Christophe Caron, Gildas Le Corguillé\nMetaboHUB : Etienne Thévenot, Franck Giacomoni, Marie Tremblay-Franco\nLABERCA : Yann Guitton\nInstitut Pasteur : Fabien Mareuil\nConference Lodging We provide a list of hotel near to the school location (Pasteur Institute).

One file is dedicated to the intensity values measured for each analytical variable and each sample, a second file gathers the meta-data concerning the samples, and a third file is about the meta-data of the analytical variables.\nDetailed information about this W4M 3-tables format is available here.\nFamiliar with Biobase formating from Bioconductor? The W4M 3-tables format is very similar to the ExpressionSets organisation of data, the main difference being that the dataMatrix table is a transposition of the assay data table:\n\n\n\nW4M format\nExpressionSets\n\n\n\n\ndataMatrix\ntransposed assay data (assayData)\n\n\nsampleMetadata\nphenotypic data (phenoData)\n\n\nvariableMetadata\nannotations and feature data (annotation)"

Among the many advantages it provides, it enables potential users as well as already initiated ones to understand what the tool is meant for and how it can be relevantly used.\nAs you may already know, there are two distinct targets for documentation, that are equally important: - the developers’ community: people that may evaluate your tool in a ‘code and structure’ perspective, that may deploy it for others or themselves to use it, and that may also contribute to its development in the future - the users’ community: people that may test your tool in order to obtain results, that may use it for their routine or R&D works, and that may even use it for learning purpose.\nW4M supports Galaxy tools that combine these two aspects of documentation. Consequently, we highly recommend that any tool you share with our community is provided with at least basic documentation for both these target publics.\n\nDocumentation for developers\nTODO Mentionner les BP (comm etc) + dire que minimum un ReadMe mais aussi les tests pour exemple a rejouer\n\n\nDocumentation for users\nThere is a large variety of ways to provide user documentations, including embedded help files, online content and even live trainings’ supports.\nAs one of Galaxy’s goals is to provide a user-friendly environment and easy access to ressources, several channels exists that are especially designed to be efficient for users (easily found, convenient to use…).\nAs W4M, we highly recommend to consider at least the three following options.\n\nThe Galaxy tool Help section\nTODO Presenter les section mandatory et facultative\nAbout the format, you can find here a template of Help tag to help you initiating your writing with the recommanded sections and formats.\n\n\nOther Galaxy tool’s XML information usefull for users\nTODO les balises recommandees\n\n\nMaterials to provide through the Galaxy Training Network\nTODO Le fait que bon moyen de mettre en ontexte un outil + Lien vers GTN et howto GTN-build + le fait que ça apparaitra direct en bas de l’outil"

Since, other contributors joins us and now we are actually an international team of dozen of peoples from several Labs.\nIn a collaborative efforts between metabolomics (  French infrastructure ) and bioinformatics platforms (  Institut Français de Bioinformatique ), we’ve crafted comprehensive LC/MS, GC/MS, and NMR pipelines using the robust  framework. Our pipelines cover the entire spectrum of data analysis, encompassing preprocessing, normalization, quality control, statistical analysis, and annotation steps.\nThese modular and adaptable workflows are carefully assembled with a combination of established components (such as XCMS and CAMERA packages) and a suite of tools developed by the  team members. Our implementation, accessible through a user-friendly web interface, ensures the completeness of parameter settings and reproducibility. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of  , we seamlessly integrate components from diverse sources and types.\nThis integration has facilitated the creation of an extensible Virtual Research Environment (VRE) tailored for metabolomics communities, including platforms and end-users. Our VRE offers preconfigured workflows for newcomers while catering to experts in the field. This collaborative approach not only ensures accessibility but also encourages knowledge-sharing and enhances the overall research experience."
